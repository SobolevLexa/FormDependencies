  Change log:

    13 feb. 2012, v1.3  - slightly improved performance (rules are parsed once, and only dependencies are now iterated during checks)
                        - changed target selector to match the container of the input fields, instead of the input fields directly
                        - added repo to github (first public release)

    23 jun. 2011, v1.2  - Fixed a problem in the value matching function

    21 jun. 2011, v1.1  - Added disable_only / clear_inactive options

    20 jun. 2011, v1.0  - First release
